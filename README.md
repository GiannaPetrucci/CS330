# Programming Language Project C++

 ### History
 C++ is an object-oriented programming language that combines low-level and high-level language.
 It was created and developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup inspired by the
 struggles in his PhD experience with C and simulation languages like Simula. C++'s development
 began in 1979 is the [fourth most popular programming language today](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).
 
 C++ has many different applications and is used to code operating systems, video games, databases,
 web browsers, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, virtual reality experiences, flight simulation
 software, and more.
 
 
 
 ### Examples of software written in C++ include:
 
 - Google Chrome Browser
 - Mozilla Firefox
 - MySQL server 
 - Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator
 - Maya (3D software used for animation and other graphics)
